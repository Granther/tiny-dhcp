# Todo
- Fix inefficient lease checking
- Put expired but not taken addrs as the end of addr queue

### Idease
- Make hyper configurable
- IE, compete with other DHCP servers on network 

### To test for
- Does addr request check that addr is in pool, or just not in leases

- For some reason the server offers and IP, but doesnt ack it
